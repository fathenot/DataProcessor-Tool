# DataProcessor

**DataProcessor** is a high-performance, typed, in-memory data processing engine for .NET, inspired by [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and built for scalable, low-level data manipulation.

It is designed to support:
- Immutable and dynamic Series/Frames with typed storage
- Efficient columnar access, vectorized operations, and shared memory interop
- Seamless integration with native backends via C++

> 🚧 **Work in progress** — feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Key Goals

- 🧠 *Systematic*: built with Microsoft-style C# architecture and strong typing
- ⚡ *Fast*: columnar design with SIMD/vectorized backends in C++
- ♻️ *Interoperable*: compatible with engines like Spark, ClickHouse, Kafka, etc.
- 🧪 *Robust views*: fault-tolerant, reactive view system inspired by Pandas — but safer and more consistent


## Quick Start

Coming soon. In the meantime, feel free to explore the codebase and open issues or discussions.
